<h4><a name="description">Description of Appeal to Consequences of a Belief</a></h4>

<p>The Appeal to the Consequences of a Belief is a fallacy that comes in
the following patterns:

<ol>

<p><li>X is true because if people did not accept X as being true  then
there would be negative consequences.

<p><li>X is false because if people did not accept X as being false,
then there would be negative consequences.

<p><li>X is true because accepting that X is true has positive
consequences.

<p><li>X is false because accepting that X is false has positive
consequences.

<p><li>I wish that X were true, therefore X is true. This is known as
Wishful Thinking.

<p><li>I wish that X were false, therefore X is false. This is known as
Wishful Thinking.

</ol>

<p>This line of &quot;reasoning&quot; is fallacious because the
consequences of a belief have no bearing on whether the belief is true
or false. For example, if someone were to say &quot;If sixteen-headed
purple unicorns don't exist, then I would be miserable, so they must
exist&quot; it would be clear that this would not be a good line of
reasoning. It is important to note that the consequences in question are
the consequences that stem from the belief.  It is important to
distinguish between a rational reason to believe (RRB) (evidence) and a
prudential reason to believe (PRB) (motivation). A RRB is evidence that
objectively and logically supports the claim. A PRB is a reason to
accept the belief because of some external factor (such as fear, a
threat, or a benefit or harm that may stem from the belief) that is
relevant to what a person values but is not relevant to the truth or
falsity of the claim.

<p>The nature of the fallacy is especially clear in the case of Wishful
thinking. Obviously, merely wishing that something is true does not make
it true. This fallacy differs from the
<a href="appeal-to-belief.html">Appeal to Belief</a>
fallacy in that the
<a href="appeal-to-belief.html">Appeal to Belief</a>
involves taking a claim that most people believe that X is true to be
evidence for X being true.

<h4><a name="examples">Examples of Appeal to Consequences of a Belief</a></h4>

<ol>

<p><li>&quot;God must exist! If God did not exist, then all basis for
morality would be lost and the world would be a horrible place!&quot;

<p><li>&quot;It can never happen to me. If I believed it could, I could
never sleep soundly at night.&quot;

<p><li>&quot;I don't think that there will be a nuclear war. If I
believed that, I wouldn't be able to get up in the morning. I mean, how
depressing.&quot;

<p><li>&quot;I acknowledge that I have no argument for the existence of
God. However, I have a great desire for God to exist and for there to be
an afterlife. Therefore I accept that God exists.&quot;

</ol>
