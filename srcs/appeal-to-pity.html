<h4><a name="description">Description of Appeal to Pity</a></h4>

<p>An Appeal to Pity is a fallacy in which a person substitutes a claim
intended to create pity for evidence in an argument. The form of the
&quot;argument&quot; is as follows:

<ol>
<p><li>P is presented, with the intent to create pity.
<li>Therefore claim C is true.
</ol>

<p>This line of &quot;reasoning&quot; is fallacious because pity does
not serve as evidence for a claim. This is extremely clear in the
following case: &quot;You must accept that 1+1=46, after all I'm
dying...&quot; While you may pity me because I am dying, it would hardly
make my claim true.

<p>This fallacy differs from the
<a href="appeal-to-consequences.html">Appeal to the Consequences of a Belief</a>
(ACB).  In the ACB fallacy, a person is using the effects of a belief as
a substitute for evidence. In the Appeal to Pity, it is the feelings of
pity or sympathy that are substituted for evidence.

<p>It must be noted that there are cases in which claims that actually
serve as evidence also evoke a feeling of pity. In such cases, the
feeling of pity is still not evidence. The following is an example of a
case in which a claim evokes pity and also serves as legitimate
evidence:

<p>Professor: &quot;You missed the midterm, Bill.&quot;
<br>Bill: &quot;I know. I think you should let me take the makeup.&quot;
<br>Professor: &quot;Why?&quot;
<br>Bill: &quot;I was hit by a truck on the way to the midterm. Since I had to go to the emergency room with a broken leg, I think I am entitled to a makeup.&quot;
<br>Professor: &quot;I'm sorry about the leg, Bill. Of course you can make it up.&quot;

<p>The above example does not involve a fallacy. While the professor
does feel sorry for Bill, she is justified in accepting Bill's claim
that he deserves a makeup. After all getting run over by a truck would
be a legitimate excuse for missing a test.

<h4><a name="examples">Examples of Appeal to Pity</a></h4>

<ol>

<p><li>Jill: &quot;He'd be a terrible coach for the team.&quot; <br>Bill:
&quot;He had his heart set on the job, and it would break if he didn't
get it.&quot; <br>Jill: &quot;I guess he'll do an adequate job.&quot;

<p><li>&quot;I'm positive that my work will meet your requirements. I really
need the job since my grandmother is sick&quot;

<p><li>&quot;I should receive an 'A' in this class. After all, if I don't
get an 'A' I won't get the fellowship that I want.&quot;

</ol>
