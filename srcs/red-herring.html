<h4><a name="description">Description of Red Herring</a></h4>

<p>A Red Herring is a fallacy in which an irrelevant topic is presented
in order to divert attention from the original issue. The basic idea is
to &quot;win&quot; an argument by leading attention away from the
argument and to another topic. This sort of &quot;reasoning&quot; has
the following form:

<ol>
<p><li>Topic A is under discussion.
<li>Topic B is introduced under the guise of being relevant to topic A (when topic B is actually not relevant to topic A).
<li>Topic A is abandoned.
</ol>

<p>This sort of &quot;reasoning&quot; is fallacious because merely
changing the topic of discussion hardly counts as an argument against a
claim.

<h4><a name="examples">Examples of Red Herring</a></h4>

<p><li>&quot;We admit that this measure is popular. But we also urge you
to note that there are so many bond issues on this ballot that the whole
thing is getting ridiculous.&quot;

<p><li>&quot;Argument&quot; for a tax cut:

<p>&quot;You know, I've begun to think that there is some merit in the
Republican's tax cut plan. I suggest that you come up with something
like it, because If we Democrats are going to survive as a party, we
have got to show that we are as tough-minded as the Republicans, since
that is what the public wants.&quot;

<p><li>&quot;Argument&quot; for making  grad school requirements
stricter:

<p>&quot;I think there is great merit in making the requirements
stricter for the graduate students. I recommend that you support it,
too. After all, we are in a budget crisis and we do not want our
salaries affected.&quot;
