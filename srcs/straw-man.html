<p align=center>Fallacy: Straw Man
<font face="arial" size=3>
<p><hr>

<h4><a name="description">Description of Straw Man</a></h4>

<p>The Straw Man fallacy is committed when a person simply ignores a
person's actual position and substitutes a distorted, exaggerated or
misrepresented version of that position. This sort of
&quot;reasoning&quot; has the following pattern:

<ol>
<p><li>Person A has position X.
<li>Person B presents position Y (which is a distorted version of X).
<li>Person B attacks position Y.
<li>Therefore X is false/incorrect/flawed.
</ol>

<p>This sort of &quot;reasoning&quot; is fallacious because attacking a
distorted version of a position simply does not constitute an attack on
the position itself. One might as well expect an attack on a poor
drawing of a person to hurt the person.

<h4><a name="examples">Examples of Straw Man</a></h4>

<ol>

<p><li>Prof. Jones: &quot;The university just cut our yearly budget by $10,000.&quot;
<br>Prof. Smith: &quot;What are we going to do?&quot;
<br>Prof. Brown: &quot;I think we should eliminate one of the teaching assistant positions. That would take care of it.&quot;
<br>Prof. Jones: &quot;We could reduce our scheduled raises instead.&quot;
<br>Prof. Brown: &quot; I can't understand why you want to bleed us dry like that, Jones.&quot;

<p><li>&quot;Senator Jones says that we should not fund the attack
submarine program. I disagree entirely. I can't understand why he wants
to leave us defenseless like that.&quot;

<p><li>Bill and Jill are arguing about cleaning out their closets:
<br>Jill: &quot;We should clean out the closets. They are getting a bit messy.&quot;
<br>Bill: &quot;Why, we just went through those closets last year. Do we have to clean them out everyday?&quot;
<br>Jill: &quot;I never said anything about cleaning them out every day. You just want too keep all your junk forever, which is just ridiculous.&quot;

</ol>
