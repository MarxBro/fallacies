<p align=center>Fallacy: Hasty Generalization
<font face="arial" size=3>
<p><hr>

<p>Also Known as: Fallacy of Insufficient Statistics, Fallacy of
Insufficient Sample, Leaping to A Conclusion, Hasty Induction.

<h4><a name="description">Description of Hasty Generalization</a></h4>

<p>This fallacy is committed when a person draws a conclusion about a
population based on a sample that is not large enough. It has the
following form:

<ol>
<p><li>Sample S, which is too small, is taken from population P.
<li>Conclusion C is drawn about Population P based on S.
</ol>

<p>The person committing the fallacy is misusing the following type of
reasoning, which is known variously as Inductive Generalization,
Generalization, and Statistical Generalization:

<ol>
<p><li>X% of all observed A's are B''s.
<li>Therefore X% of all A's are Bs.
</ol>

<p>The fallacy is committed when not enough A's are observed to warrant
the conclusion. If enough A's are observed then the reasoning is not
fallacious.

<p>Small samples will tend to be unrepresentative. As a blatant case,
asking one person what she thinks about gun control would clearly not
provide an adequate sized sample for determing what Canadians in general
think about the issue. The general idea is that small samples are less
likely to contain numbers proportional to the whole population. For
example, if a bucket contains blue, red, green and orange marbles, then
a sample of three marbles cannot possible be representative of the whole
population of marbles. As the sample size of marbles increases the more
likely it becomes that marbles of each color will be selected in
proprtion to their numbers in the whole population. The same holds true
for things others than marbles, such as people and their political
views.

<p>Since Hasty Generalization is committed when the sample (the observed
instances) is too small, it is important to have samples that are large
enough when making a generalization. The most reliable way to do this is
to take as large a sample as is practical. There are no fixed numbers as
to what counts as being large enough. If the population in question is
not very diverse (a population of cloned mice, for example) then a very
small sample would suffice. If the population is very diverse (people,
for example) then a fairly large sample would be needed. The size of the
sample also depends on the size of the population. Obviously, a very
small population will not support a huge sample. Finally, the required
size will depend on the purpose of the sample. If Bill wants to know
what Joe and Jane think about gun control, then a sample consisting of
Bill and Jane would (obviously) be large enough. If Bill wants to know
what most Australians think about gun control, then a sample consisting
of Bill and Jane would be far too small.

<p>People often commit Hasty Generalizations because of bias or
prejudice. For example, someone who is a sexist might conclude that all
women are unfit to fly jet fighters because one woman crashed one.
People also commonly commit Hasty Generalizations because of laziness or
sloppiness. It is very easy to simply leap to a conclusion and much
harder to gather an adequate sample and draw a justified conclusion.
Thus, avoiding this fallacy requires minimizing the influence of bias
and taking care to select a sample that is large enough.

<p>One final point: a Hasty Generalization, like any fallacy, might have
a true conclusion. However, as long as the reasoning is fallacious there
is no reason to accept the conclusion based on that reasoning.

<h4><a name="examples">Examples of Hasty Generalization</a></h4>

<ol>

<p><li>Smith, who is from England, decides to attend graduate school at Ohio State University.  He has never been to the US before. The day after he arrives, he is walking back from an orientation session and sees two white (albino) squirrels chasing each other around a tree. In his next letter home, he tells his family that American squirrels are white. 

<p><li>Sam is riding her bike in her home town in Maine, minding her own business. A station wagon comes up behind her and the driver starts beeping his horn and then tries to force her off the road. As he goes by, the driver yells &quot;get on the sidewalk where you belong!&quot; Sam sees that the car has Ohio plates and concludes that all Ohio drivers are jerks.

<p><li>Bill: &quot;You know, those feminists all hate men.&quot;
<br>Joe: &quot;Really?&quot;
<br>Bill: &quot;Yeah. I was in my philosophy class the other day and that Rachel chick gave a presentation.&quot;
<br>Joe: &quot;Which Rachel?&quot;
<br>Bill: &quot;You know her. She's the one that runs that feminist group over at the Women's Center. She said that men are all sexist pigs. I asked her why she believed this and she said that her last few boyfriends were real sexist pigs. &quot;
<br>Joe: &quot;That doesn't sound like a good reason to believe that all of us are pigs.&quot;
<br>Bill: &quot;That was what I said.&quot;
<br>Joe: &quot;What did she say?&quot;
<br>Bill: &quot;She said that she had seen enough of men to know we are all pigs. She obviously hates all men.&quot;
<br>Joe: &quot;So you think all feminists are like her?&quot;
<br>Bill: &quot;Sure. They all hate men.&quot;

</ol>
