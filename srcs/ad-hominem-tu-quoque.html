<p>Also Known as: &quot;You Too Fallacy&quot;

<h4><a name="description">Description of Ad Hominem Tu Quoque</a></h4>

<p>This fallacy is committed when it is concluded that a person's claim
is false because 1) it is inconsistent with something else a person has
said or 2) what a person says is inconsistent with her actions. This
type of &quot;argument&quot; has the following form:

<ol>
<p><li>Person A makes claim X.
<li>Person B asserts that A's actions or past claims are inconsistent with the truth of claim X.
<li>Therefore X is false.
</ol>

<p>The fact that a person makes inconsistent claims does not make any
particular claim he makes false (although of any pair of inconsistent
claims only one can be true - but both can be false). Also, the fact
that a person's claims are not consistent with his actions might
indicate that the person is a hypocrite but this does not prove his
claims are false.

<h4><a name="examples">Examples of Ad Hominem Tu Quoque</a></h4>

<ol>

<p><li>Bill: &quot;Smoking is very unhealthy and leads to all sorts of problems. So take my advice and never start.&quot;
<br>Jill: &quot;Well, I certainly don't want to get cancer.&quot;
<br>Bill: &quot;I'm going to get a smoke. Want to join me Dave?&quot;
<br>Jill: &quot;Well, I guess smoking can't be that bad. After all, Bill smokes.&quot;

<p><li>Jill: &quot;I think the gun control bill shouldn't be supported because it won't be effective and will waste money.&quot;
<br>Bill: &quot;Well, just last month you supported the bill. So I guess you're wrong now.&quot;

<p><li>Peter: &quot;Based on the arguments I have presented, it is evident that it is morally wrong to use animals for food or clothing.&quot;
<br>Bill: &quot;But you are wearing a leather jacket and you have a roast beef sandwich in your hand! How can you say that using animals for food and clothing is wrong!&quot;

</ol>
