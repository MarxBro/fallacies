<p>Also Known as: Appeal to Mockery, The Horse Laugh.

<h4><a name="description">Description of Appeal to Ridicule</a></h4>

<p>The Appeal to Ridicule is a fallacy in which ridicule or mockery is
substituted for evidence in an &quot;argument.&quot; This line of
&quot;reasoning&quot; has the following form:

<ol>
<p><li>X, which is some form of ridicule is presented (typically directed at the claim).
<li>Therefore claim C is false.
</ol>

<p>This sort of &quot;reasoning&quot; is fallacious because mocking a
claim does not show that it is false. This is especially clear in the
following example: &quot;1+1=2! That's the most ridiculous thing I have
ever heard!&quot;

<p>It should be noted that showing that a claim is ridiculous through
the use of legitimate methods (such as a non fallacious argument) can
make it reasonable to reject the claim. One form of this line of
reasoning is known as a &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; (&quot;reducing
to absurdity&quot;). In this sort of argument, the idea is to show that
a contradiction (a statement that must be false) or an absurd result
follows from a claim. For example: &quot;Bill claims that a member of a
minority group cannot be a racist. However, this is absurd. Think about
this: white males are a minority in the world. Given Bill's claim, it
would follow that no white males could be racists. Hence, the Klan,
Nazis, and white supremists are not racist organizations.&quot;

<p>Since the claim that the Klan, Nazis, and white supremists are not
racist organizations is clearly absurd, it can be concluded that the
claim that a member of a minority cannot be a racist is false.

<h4><a name="examples">Examples of Appeal to Ridicule</a></h4>

<ol>

<p><li>&quot;Sure my worthy opponent claims that we should lower tuition,
but that is just laughable.&quot;

<p><li>&quot;Support the ERA? Sure, when the women start paying for the
drinks! Hah! Hah!&quot;

<p><li>&quot;Those wacky conservatives! They think a strong military is the
key to peace!&quot;

</ol>
