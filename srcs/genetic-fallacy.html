<h4><a name="description">Description of Genetic Fallacy</a></h4>

<p>A Genetic Fallacy is a line of &quot;reasoning&quot; in which a
perceived defect in the origin of a claim or thing is taken to be
evidence that discredits the claim or thing itself. It is also a line of
reasoning in which the origin of a claim or thing is taken to be
evidence for the claim or thing. This sort of &quot;reasoning&quot; has
the following form:

<ol>
<p><li>The origin of a claim or thing is presented.
<li>The claim is true(or false) or  the thing is supported (or discredited).
</ol>

<p>It is clear that sort of &quot;reasoning&quot; is fallacious. For
example: &quot;Bill claims that 1+1=2. However, my parents brought me up
to believe that 1+1=254, so Bill must be wrong.&quot;

<p>It should be noted that there are some cases in which the origin of a
claim is relevant to the truth or falsity of the claim. For example, a
claim that comes from a reliable expert is likely to be true (provided
it is in her area of expertise).

<h4><a name="examples">Examples of Genetic Fallacy</a></h4>

<ol>

<p><li>&quot;The current Chancellor of Germany was in the Hitler Youth
at age 3. With that sort of background, his so called 'reform' plan must
be a facist program.&quot;

<p><li>&quot;I was brought up to believe in God, and my parents told me
God exists, so He must.&quot;

<p><li>&quot;Sure, the media claims that Senator Bedfellow was taking
kickbacks. But we all know about the media's credibility, don't
we.&quot;

</ol>
