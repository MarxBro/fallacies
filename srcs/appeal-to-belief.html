<h4><a name="description">Description of Appeal to Belief</a></h4>

<p>Appeal to Belief is a fallacy that has this general pattern:

<ol>
<p><li>Most people believe that a claim, X, is true.
<li>Therefore X is true.
</ol>

<p>This line of &quot;reasoning&quot; is fallacious because the fact
that many people believe a claim does not, in general, serve as evidence
that the claim is true.

<p>There are, however, some cases when the fact that many people accept
a claim as true is an indication that it is true. For example, while you
are visiting Maine, you are told by several people that they believe
that people older than 16 need to buy a fishing license in order to
fish. Barring reasons to doubt these people, their statements give you
reason to believe that anyone over 16 will need to buy a fishing
license.

<p>There are also cases in which what people believe actually determines
the truth of a claim. For example, the truth of claims about manners and
proper behavior might simply depend on what people believe to be good
manners and proper behavior. Another example is the case of community
standards, which are often taken to be the standards that most people
accept. In some cases, what violates certain community standards is
taken to be obscene. In such cases, for the claim &quot;x is
obscene&quot; to be true is for most people in that community to believe
that x is obscene. In such cases it is still prudent to question the
justification of the individual beliefs.

<h4><a name="examples">Examples of Appeal to Belief</a></h4>

<ol>

<p><li>At one time, most people in Europe believed that the earth was the
center of the solar system (at least most of those who had beliefs about
such things). However, this belief turned out to be false.

<p><li>God must exist. After all, I just saw a poll that says 85% of all
Americans believe in God.

<p><li>Of course there is nothing wrong with drinking. Ask anyone, he'll
tell you that he thinks drinking is just fine.

</ol>
