<p>Also Known as: Circular Reasoning, Reasoning in a Circle, Petitio Principii.

<h4><a name="description">Description of Begging the Question</a></h4>

<p>Begging the Question is a fallacy in which the premises include the
claim that the conclusion is true or (directly or indirectly) assume
that the conclusion is true.  This sort of &quot;reasoning&quot;
typically has the following form.

<ol>
<p><li>Premises in which the truth of the conclusion is claimed or the truth of the conclusion is assumed (either directly or indirectly).
<li>Claim C (the conclusion) is true.
</ol>

<p>This sort of &quot;reasoning&quot; is fallacious because simply
assuming that the conclusion is true (directly or indirectly) in the
premises does not constitute evidence for that conclusion. Obviously,
simply assuming a claim is true does not serve as evidence for that
claim. This is especially clear in particularly blatant cases: &quot;X
is true. The evidence for this claim is that X is true.&quot;

<p>Some cases of question begging are fairly blatant, while others can
be extremely subtle.

<h4><a name="examples">Examples of Begging the Question</a></h4>

<ol>

<p><li>Bill: &quot;God must exist.&quot;
<br>Jill: &quot;How do you know.&quot;
<br>Bill: &quot;Because the Bible says so.&quot;
<br>Jill: &quot;Why should I believe the Bible?&quot;
<br>Bill: &quot;Because the Bible was written by God.&quot;

<p><li>&quot;If such actions were not illegal, then they would not be prohibited by the law.&quot;

<p><li>&quot;The belief in God is universal. After all, everyone believes in God.&quot;

<p><li>Interviewer: &quot;Your resume looks impressive but I need another reference.&quot;
<br>Bill: &quot;Jill can give me a good reference.&quot;
<br>Interviewer: &quot;Good. But how do I know that Jill is trustworthy?&quot;
<br>Bill: &quot;Certainly. I can vouch for her.&quot;

</ol>
