<h4><a name="description">Description of Appeal to Flattery</a></h4>

<p>An Appeal to Flattery is a fallacy of the following form:

<ol>
<p><li>Person A is flattered by person B.
<li>Person B makes claim X.
<li>Therefore X is true.
</ol>

<p>The basic idea behind this fallacy is that flattery is presented in
the place of evidence for accepting a claim. this sort of
&quot;reasoning&quot; is fallacious because flattery is not, in fact,
evidence for a claim. This is especially clear in a case like this:
&quot;My Bill, that is a really nice tie. By the way, it is quite clear
that one plus one is equal to forty three.&quot;

raise...&quot;

<p><li>&quot;That was a singularly brilliant idea. I have never seen such a
clear and eloquent defense of Plato's position. If you do not mind, I'll
base my paper on it. Provided that you allow me a little extra time past
the deadline to work on it.&quot;
