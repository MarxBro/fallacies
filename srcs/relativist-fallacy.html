<p align=center>Fallacy: Relativist Fallacy
<font face="arial" size=3>
<p><hr>

<p>Also Known as: The Subjectivist Fallacy.

<h4><a name="description">Description of Relativist Fallacy</a></h4>

<p>The Relativist Fallacy is committed when a person rejects a claim by
asserting that the claim might be true for others but is not for
him/her. This sort of &quot;reasoning&quot; has the following form:

<ol>
<p><li>Claim X is presented.
<li>Person A asserts that X may be true for others but is not true for him/her.
<li>Therefore A is justified in rejecting X.
</ol>

<p>In this context, relativism is the view that truth is relative to Z
(a person, time, culture, place, etc.). This is not the view that claims
will be true at different times or of different people, but the view
that a claim could be true for one person and false for another at the
same time.

<p>In many cases, when people say &quot;that X is true for me&quot; what
they really mean is &quot;I believe X&quot; or &quot;X is true about
me.&quot; It is important to be quite clear about the distinction
between being true about a person and being true for a person. A claim
is true about a person if the claim is a statement that describes the
person correctly. For example, &quot;Bill has blue eyes&quot; is true of
Bill if Bill has blue eyes. To make a claim such as &quot;X is true for
Bill&quot; is to say that the claim is true for Bill and that it need
not be true for others. For example: &quot;1+1=23 is true for Bill&quot;
would mean that, for Bill, 1+1 actually does equal 23, not that he
merely believes that 1+1=23 (that would be &quot;It is true of Bill that
he believes 1+1=23&quot;). Another example would be &quot;The claim that
the earth is flat is true for Bill&quot; would mean that the earth
really is flat for Bill (in other words, Bill would be in a different
world than the rest of the human race). Since these situations (1+1
being 23 and the earth being flat for Bill) are extremely strange, it
certainly seems that truth is not relative to individuals (although
beliefs are).

<p>As long as truth is objective (that is, not relative to individuals),
then the Relativist Fallacy is a fallacy. If there are cases in which
truth is actually relative, then such reasoning need not be fallacious.

<h4><a name="examples">Examples of Relativist Fallacy</a></h4>

<ol>

<p><li>Jill: "Look at this, Bill. I read that people who do not get enough exercise tend to be unhealthy."
<br>Bill: "That may be true for you, but it is not true for me."

<p><li>Jill: "I think that so called argument you used to defend your position is terrible. After all, a fallacy hardly counts as an argument. "
<br>Bill: "That may be true for you, but it is not true for me."

<p><li>Bill: "Your position results in a contradiction, so I can't accept it."
<br>Dave: "Contradictions may be bad on your Eurocentric, oppressive, logical world view, but I don't think they are bad. Therefore my position is just fine."

</ol>
