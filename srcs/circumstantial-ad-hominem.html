<h4><a name="description">Description of Circumstantial Ad Hominem</a></h4>

<p>A Circumstantial ad Hominem is a fallacy in which one attempts to
attack a claim by asserting that the person making the claim is making
it simply out of self interest. In some cases, this fallacy involves
substituting an attack on a person's circumstances (such as the person's
religion, political affiliation, ethnic background, etc.). The fallacy
has the following forms:

<ol>
<p><li>Person A makes claim X.
<li>Person B asserts that A makes claim X because it is in A's interest to claim X.
<li>Therefore claim X is false.
</ol>

<ol>
<p><li>Person A makes claim X.
<li>Person B makes an attack on A's circumstances.
<li>Therefore X is false.
</ol>

<p>A Circumstantial ad Hominem is a fallacy because a person's interests
and circumstances have no bearing on the truth or falsity of the claim
being made. While a person's interests will provide them with motives to
support certain claims, the claims stand or fall on their own. It is
also the case that a person's circumstances (religion, political
affiliation, etc.) do not affect the truth or falsity of the claim. This
is made quite clear by the following example: &quot;Bill claims that
1+1=2. But he is a Republican, so his claim is false.&quot;

<p>There are times when it is prudent to suspicious of a person's
claims, such as when it is evident that the claims are being biased by
the person's interests. For example, if a  tobacco company
representative claims that tobacco does not cause cancer, it would be
prudent to not simply accept the claim. This is because the person has a
motivation to make the claim, whether it is true or not. However, the
mere fact that the person has a motivation to make the claim does not
make it false. For example, suppose a parent  tells her son that
sticking a fork in a light socket would be dangerous. Simply because she
has a motivation to say this obviously does not make her claim false.

<h4><a name="examples">Examples of Circumstantial Ad Hominem</a></h4>

<ol>

<p><li>&quot;She asserts that we need more military spending, but that
is false, since she is only saying it because she is a Republican.&quot;

<p><li>&quot;I think that we should reject what Father Jones has to say
about the ethical issues of abortion because he is a Catholic priest.
After all, Father Jones is required to hold such views.&quot;

<p><li>&quot;Of course the Senator from Maine opposes a reduction in
naval spending. After all, Bath Ironworks, which produces warships, is
in Maine.&quot;

<p><li>&quot;Bill claims that tax breaks for corporations increases
development. Of course, Bill is the CEO of a corporation.&quot;

</ol>
